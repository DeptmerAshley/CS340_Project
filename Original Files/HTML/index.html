<h2>HOME PAGE</h2>

<p>This website allows the user to interact with the Youth Basketball
Schedule Management Tool. This tool is a databse that allows a youth basketball
league to track players, teams, games, gyms, and coaches for a basketball league. Each
page in the website is described briefly below. The user may use this website
to interact with the database.</p>

<h3>COACHES PAGE</h3>
<p>This page allows the user to view all coaches in the league. The user may
also use this page to add a new coach to the database management sytsem. Each
coach may coach for more than one team.</p>

<h3>TEAMS PAGE</h3>
<p>The teams page gives the user the ability to view all the teams in the league.
The user may also use this page to add a new team to the league database.
Each team that is added to the database must have a coach assigned.</p>

<h3>PLAYERS PAGE</h3>
<p>The players page allows the user to view all players in the league and add
a new player to the league. Each player that is added to the league must be
added to a team. The player information that is recorded when adding a player
it the player name, email, birthday, and team they play for. The players page
also contains the delete option. The user may select a player from a dropdown
menu and delete that player from the database.</p>

<h3>GAMES PAGE</h3>
<p>The games page is the page that shows all the games in the league. This page
shows each game, the gym the game is played at, the day of the game, and the teams
in each game. The user may also add a new game to the database from this page.
This page shows the update functionality where a user may update
the date or gym location for a game in the database.</p>
<p>Lastly, this page contains the delete function for the M:M intersection table.
The intersection table here is the intersection of teams and games (each team
plays in multiple games, and each game has multiple teams). This page contains a
form to delete a team from a game, thus disassociateing that team from a game.</p>

<h3>GYMS PAGE</h3>
<p>Simple page that allows the user to view all the gyms in the database. The
gyms are the locations where the games take place. The user may also add a new
